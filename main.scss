// We are following a pattern called ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS). ITCSS's
// concept is based mainly around layering on styles based on their reach within
// the DOM. We are also using this in combination with BEM and name spacing.

// Generic, far-reaching, low specificity styles are declared first:

// Settings: Global variables, config switches.
@import "01-settings/index";

// Tools: Default mixins and functions.
@import "02-tools/index";

// Generic: Ground-zero styles (Normalize.css, resets, box-sizing).
@import "03-generic/index";

// Elements: Unclassed HTML elements (type selectors).
@import "04-elements/index";

// Objects: Cosmetic-free design patterns.
@import "05-objects/index";

// Components: Designed components, chunks of UI.
@import "06-components/index";

// Trumps: Utilities and Helper classes with the ability to override everything
// and anything with an !important or that uses an ID for a selector
@import "07-trumps/index";

// Explicit, localised, higher specificity styles are declared last.
